# EROS: Emergency Response Coordination OS

EROS is a unified real-time emergency coordination platform designed to reduce response times by connecting citizens, ambulances, and hospitals.

## Architecture

- **Backend Engine (`services/backend-engine`)**: Node.js + Express + Socket.io + Firestore. Handles real-time SOS broadcasting and persistence.
- **AI Router (`services/ai-router`)**: Python + FastAPI. Implements Haversine routing for nearest ambulance assignment.
- **Dispatch Dashboard (`apps/dispatch-dashboard`)**: Next.js 15 + TailwindCSS. High-visibility command center for emergency dispatchers.

## Database Layer
- **Firebase Firestore**: Real-time sync of active SOS calls and GPS tracking.
